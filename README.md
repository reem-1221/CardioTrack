# CardioTrack
AI-powered ECG Classification Dashboard using Deep Learning (ResNet18). Designed for research and educational exploration of cardiac rhythm analysis.
# ❤️ CardioTrack AI: ECG Classification Dashboard
CardioTrack is a computer vision application that utilizes a **ResNet18 Deep Learning model** to classify Electrocardiogram (ECG) images into three categories: **Normal, Arrhythmia, and Myocardial Infarction.**
## 🔬 Project Purpose
This application was developed as a **research project** to explore the intersection of healthcare and Artificial Intelligence. It serves as a learning tool to understand:
* How Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) interpret visual patterns in medical signals.
* How to deploy machine learning models using Streamlit.
* The workflow of medical data preprocessing in PyTorch.
## ⚠️ Medical Disclaimer
**IMPORTANT: This application is for educational and research purposes ONLY.**
* It is **NOT** a certified medical device.
* The predictions made by this AI should **never** replace the professional judgment of a qualified cardiologist or medical doctor.
* Do not use this app to make any health-related decisions. Always seek professional medical advice for heart-related concerns.

##🚀 Features
* **AI Analysis:** Instant classification of ECG scans.
